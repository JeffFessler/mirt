% function [ output_im ] = sewpatches(input_patches, output_sz, patch_stsz)
%   Combine evenly spaced patches into a single image, averaging at voxels
%   in more than one patch. Allows for the input of patches from multiple
%   output images, if each image has been divided into similarly sized and
%   spaced patches.
%
% Inputs:
%   input_patches   [nlin_patch, ncol_patch, npatch]  stack of input patches
%   output size     2 x 1   dimentions of output 2D image
%   patch_stsz      1 x 1     step size btwn patches (stride)
%
% Outputs:
%   output_im       [nlin, ncol, nims]   sewed together images
