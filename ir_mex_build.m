% some of the functions in this toolbox use calls to mex files.
% the source code for *some*, but not all, of those mex files
% is included with the toolbox, and can be created by running this script.

% The full MIRT toolbox with complete mex files can be found at:
% http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/index.html

% This script and the scripts it calls have been tested
% for compiling on Mac, PC, and Linux.
