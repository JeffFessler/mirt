This directory containts Matlab tools for
nonrigid image registration using b-splines,
developed by Se Young Chun at the University of Michigan,
with input by Jeff Fessler,
and support by NIH grant P01 CA87634.

Most of the Matlab mex files here are wrappers around
the Bspline software available from EPFL:
	http://bigwww.epfl.ch/algorithms.html
by P. Thevenaz and M. Unser, and redistributed here with their permission.
We own them a big thanks for their online code!

HOW TO INSTALL (only needed if the mex files for your system
are not already in the mex/ directory!):
cd bsplinetool

% Ensure that 'makefile' has the correct MPATH value which 
% is your MATLAB bin directory location.
make

% then you can see mex files in mex directory.
% set the current directory as well as mex directory as paths
% in MATLAB for use
