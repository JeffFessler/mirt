This directory contains Matlab files
related to reconstruction of magnetic resonance (MR) images,
including fast iterative correction for field inhomogeneity.

The contents were created by Jeff Fessler, Doug Noll, and Brad Sutton,
and others.
Look especially for papers/preprints authored by Sutton at the web site:
	http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/papers

The recon subdirectory has the original code for iterative MR reconstruction
with field correction by Brad Sutton.  It came originally from:
	/net/ir5/u/bpsutton/Reconitmr/
This recon code is now obsolete and unsupported.
The object "Gmri.m" is now recommended instead.
See ../example/mri_*.m for usage.

Look at mri_field_map_reg.m to see ohow we clean up our field maps
before doing iterative reconstruction for fMRI.
todo: need to document Michael Allison's newer approach...
