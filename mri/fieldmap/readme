The functions in this directory are all related to B0 field maps in MRI.

todo: these functions probably should warn the user if the estimated
field map approaches the wrapping frequency when there is only one pair
of echo times.

todo:
need to have similar winit for all methods
and to fix up the scale stuff

Simulating B0 field maps:
 mri_field_map_cyl.m
 mri_field_map_sim.m

Recommended methods for estimating B0 field maps:
 mri_fieldmap_pcg_ls.m  (calls fmap_est_pcg_ls.m)
 mri_fieldmap_qm.m      (calls fmap_est_qm.m)
See code/data here:

Older methods for estimating B0 field maps, retained for completeness:
 mri_field_map_reg.m
 ir_mri_field_map_reg_scale.m
 mri_phase_denoise.m
 mri_phase_denoise_sim1.m
 unwrapping_sps_manysets.m
